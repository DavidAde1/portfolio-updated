    interviewRound1: '-> Aptitude Test',
    round1Content1: 'There were 60-minutes given as time limit that created intense pressure to answer 60 complex logic and coding problems. Those 60-minutes will be my fastest 60-minutes which felt like a few seconds and i love the thrill that i felt during that time.',
    round1Content2: `I knew I could do this. I had been preparing for this moment for weeks. I had practiced solving logic and coding problems, and I had read up on the different types of questions that could be asked. I was ready. But as the clock ticked down, my anxiety started to get the best of me. I started to doubt myself. What if I wasn't good enough? What if I didn't get enough questions right?`,
    round1Content3: 'I took a deep breath to calm down and clear my head. I was able to solve the first few problems relatively quickly, but then I started focusing on focusing on quality over quantity, as i was only solving those questions which i was sure about.',
